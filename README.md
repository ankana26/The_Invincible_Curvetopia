# Curve Regularization and Symmetry Detection in 2D Euclidean Space
## Objective
This repository contains Python scripts for detecting various geometric shapes and patterns from 2D curve data. The scripts use different algorithms and methods to identify line segments, circles, ellipses, star shapes, and symmetry in the given datasets.
